<p>In this chapter we&#39;ll introduce Webpack to the project. It&#39;s main purpose is to bundle JS and CSS for the
frontend stack. Secondly we will exploit Webpack&#39;s HMR feature to the maximum to enhance the Developer experience. If
all goes according to plan, each change will almost instantly be reflected in youw browser without haven to manually
refresh!</p>
<h3 id="installing-packages">Installing packages</h3>
<pre><code>yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader</code></pre><p>The <code>webpack</code> is the core package that does the actual compiling.</p>
<p><code>webpack-cli</code> is responsible for providing a CLI
interface. This doesn&#39;t do much as long as we don&#39;t have a configuration, so let&#39;s move on to the next step!</p>
<p>The Babel packages are explained below.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/webberig/webpack-express-ultimate-sample/commit/686629553ab30fc3d618507a8ea97dcd82d05910">commit for this step</a></p>
<h3 id="configuring-webpack">Configuring Webpack</h3>
<p>Since we have some configuration options needed in different places, we should put them in a separate file ie.
<code>/src/config.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const path = require(&quot;path&quot;);

module.exports = {
    isProd: process.env.NODE_ENV === &quot;production&quot;,
    hmrEnabled: process.env.NODE_ENV !== &quot;production&quot; &amp;&amp; !process.env.NO_HMR,
    distFolder: path.resolve(__dirname, &quot;../dist&quot;),
    publicPath: &quot;/assets&quot;,
    wdsPort: 3001,
};</code></pre>
<p>These options will be explained as soon as they&#39;re being used. Create a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file containing following
 minimal configuration:</p>
<pre><code>const config = require(&quot;./src/config&quot;);

var webpackConfig = {
    entry: {main: [&quot;./src/client/main.js&quot;]},
    output: {
        path: config.distFolder,
        filename: &quot;main.bundle.js&quot;,
        publicPath: &quot;/assets/&quot;
    },
    mode: config.isProd ? &quot;production&quot; : &quot;development&quot;,
};

module.exports = webpackConfig;</code></pre><p>The <code>entry</code> option contains so called entry points, those files are used as a starting point to detect the dependency
 tree of your frontend bundle. This is exactly what webpack does: it parses your code, looks for dependencies
  (supporting multiple ways to declare them) and compiles everything to a single &#39;bundle&#39; which is usually a JS file.</p>
<p><code>output</code> defines where Webpack can put the resulting bundle and how to name it. You can also see the <code>publicPath</code>
 option. This needs to be the URL path of where the bundle will be located inside your website. </p>
<p>If <code>mode</code> is set to production, Webpack will pre-configure some plugins to optimize and minify your bundle.</p>
<p>In this config I have 1 entry which uses <code>/src/client/main.js</code> and call it &quot;main&quot;. Webpack will output a JS file
 <code>/dist/main.bundle.js</code>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we should now create that entry file:</p>
<pre><code>// /src/client/main.js
console.log(&quot;Hello, from src/client/main.js with love&quot;);</code></pre><p>Don&#39;t worry much about that content, we wil add more useful things later. This will be the file where you start coding
(or requiring) your frontend modules.</p>
<h4 id="testing-the-build">Testing the build</h4>
<p>We&#39;re ready to give Webpack a go. Run following command to build your frontend bundle:</p>
<pre><code>./node_modules/.bin/webpack</code></pre><p>After running the build, you should see that <code>/dist/main.bundle.js</code> has appeared in your project. You should see
 a result like this:</p>
<p><img src="/chapter-2/webpack-first-run.png" alt="Webpack run"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/webberig/webpack-express-ultimate-sample/commit/4c84fce01fae98998eb0aa3a430f367634364048">commit for this step</a></p>
<h3 id="adding-the-bundle-to-your-html">Adding the bundle to your HTML</h3>
<p>Before we can add the bundle to the webpages, we&#39;ll need to tell Express you want this folder to be served as
 &quot;static assets&quot;. Require the config to configure the static middleware with ease. I suggest putting the middleware 
 after the already existing <code>express.static</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code>// /src/server/app.js
const config = require(&quot;../config&quot;);
... 
app.use(config.publicPath, express.static(config.distFolder));</code></pre><p>You don&#39;t need to delete the <code>/public</code> folder or remove the other <code>express.static</code> statement. This can still be used for
 other assets you don&#39;t want Webpack to process.</p>
<p>Now add the script tag to your website&#39;s HTML:</p>
<pre><code>// /src/server/views/layout.twig
&lt;script src=&quot;/assets/main.bundle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre><p>Make sure your app is running (<code>yarn start</code>), point your browser to the page <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> and open the dev
console in your browser. You should see the loving message appearing from our bundle.</p>
<p><img src="/chapter-2/browser-with-bundle.png" alt="Browser with console output from bundle"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/webberig/webpack-express-ultimate-sample/commit/6ac5e7b217bae8677555c9033ccaa5383b68c375">commit for this step</a></p>
<h3 id="adding-babel">Adding Babel</h3>
<h4 id="webpack-loaders">Webpack loaders</h4>
<p>Webpack knows how to handle JS files by default, but you can extend support for additional file types by adding
so-called &#39;loaders&#39;. Ie. if you add <code>require(&quot;style.css&quot;)</code> to your entry, you&#39;ll need to add the <code>style-loader</code> to
the webpack config so webpack knows how to include the CSS into the bundle (and applying the styles upon loading).</p>
<p>For now, we want to improve how JS is being handled by adding Babel. If you haven&#39;t heard of it,
<a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel js</a> is a compiler that supports the latest syntax and features (ES6, ES2015, ...) and
 transpiles it to older Javascript that browsers can understand.</p>
<p>We already added 3 dependencies to our project:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@babel/core</code> is the actual compiler</li>
<li><code>@babel/preset-env</code> is a preset that automates configuration based on browsers you wish to support</li>
<li><code>babel-loader</code> is the Webpack &#39;loader&#39; which will integrate Babel into your Babel stack</li>
</ul>
<p>In Webpack, adding Babel is piece-of-cake. Just add the <code>babel-loader</code> in our <code>webpack.config.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code>...
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.m?js$/,
                exclude: /(node_modules)/,
                use: {
                    loader: &#39;babel-loader&#39;,
                    options: {
                        presets: [&#39;@babel/preset-env&#39;]
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
...</code></pre><p>Webpack uses a rule-based architecture to determine which loaders are used for which regex matches. In this case, we
look for any <code>.js</code> or <code>.mjs</code> files, exclude dependencies in the <code>node_modules</code> folder and use the <code>babel-loader</code> for any
matching files.</p>
<p>You can test the setup by adding some ES6/7/2015 syntax in your <code>/src/client/main.js</code> and run webpack.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/webberig/webpack-express-ultimate-sample/commit/24892c48874ceb6b3af79f17b29c03589e3927fc">commit for this step</a></p>
<h2 id="tip-tricks">Tip &amp; Tricks</h2>
<p>You can also install Webpack globally (<code>npm install -g webpack webpack-cli</code>). If you do that, you can simply run
the <code>webpack</code> command.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the code in the bundle won&#39;t change by itself. You need to re-run the <code>webpack</code> command every time
you make a change. However, Webpack also has a built-in watch feature. Just run <code>webpack -w</code> and it will watch all files
 in the dependency tree of your client code and rebuild when you make a change.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can now run Webpack manually to build your frontend bundle. This is a basic but workable setup. The focus of this book 
however is to add more automation to webpack and integrate it deeper in your app. We want webpack to build the bundle
upon start, trigger re-build automatically upon changes and signal the browser so it reloads. </p>
<p>After completing this chapter, your app should look like the sample app in the
 <a href="https://github.com/webberig/webpack-express-ultimate-sample/tree/chapter-2">chapter-2</a> tag.</p>
