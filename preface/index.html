<p>A few years ago I started replacing Grunt build steps with Webpack. It gave my team much more power and control over
 the JS build artifacts. I knew Webpack had much more potential but only recently I&#39;ve had a chance using Webpack
  for building CSS too. I couldn&#39;t resist running ecstatically to my colleague&#39;s desks with my laptop to show how
   CSS gets reloaded instantly without the browser having to reload!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also grown fond of Express and NodeJs. I sensed the possibility of giving the server-side code the same
developer experience. I&#39;ve come close but never achieved the &quot;holy grail&quot; scaffold. After trying many different 
approaches from others (even building the Express app as a webpack bundle!), I finally ended up with the solution, the
holy grail, in this book.</p>
<p>The protagonists of the book are <strong>Express</strong> and <strong>Webpack</strong>. The chapters in this book aren&#39;t just a step-by-step guide
to get you through the process, it will provide insights to all steps taken. </p>
<p>Keep in mind though that this book assumes some basic understanding of both protagonists and you have actually worked
 with an Express app.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>This is what defines the holy grail (at least, for me personally):</p>
<ol>
<li>Build (client-side) JS</li>
<li>Client-side Javascript should be transpiled with <strong>Babel</strong></li>
<li><strong>Webpack</strong> should be configured to make a JS bundle</li>
<li>Build CSS</li>
<li>Compile <strong>SASS/SCSS</strong></li>
<li>Pass through PostCSS, mainly to apply the <strong>Autoprefixer</strong> plugin</li>
<li>Hot module replacement</li>
<li>Instantly apply CSS changes without reloading the browser</li>
<li>Refresh the page upon JS changes</li>
<li>Refresh the page upon changes in the Express app</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sample-project">Sample project</h2>
<p>This book will often refer to a sample project on Github with clean commits and tags for each chapter.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/webberig/webpack-express-ultimate-sample">https://github.com/webberig/webpack-express-ultimate-sample</a></p>
<p>Each of those commits will be explained in detail in each of the corresponding chapter.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-author">About the author</h2>
<p><strong>Mathieu Maes</strong> is a front-end developer at <a href="https://www.zimmo.be/">Zimmo.be</a>, located in Leuven (Belgium). With over
15 years of experience in web development, he&#39;s built countless of websites and applications. He could setup a good
 number of tools or frameworks in his sleep, which is why he&#39;s usually responsible for project scaffolding. That 
 doesn&#39;t mean he gets actual work done in his sleep, nor he sleeps at work!</p>
